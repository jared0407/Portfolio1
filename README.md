This is a REACT based site to mock a computer parts website

This is manually uploaded due to VSC giving me errors when trying continuously.

https://github.com/jared0407/Portfolio1/tree/portfolio is where everything is uploaded to, the menu and menu items are there too but couldn't be in their own folders 


The project stems from the food menu project and is turned into a computer part form. I have added colors, and a horizontal rule to tidy up the form.
